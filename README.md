# Updating "source.list" file of multiple Raspberry Pi with Bash script

When we initially flashed a memory card for a TurtleBot from the [eManual Robotis website](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/sbc_setup/), it comes with the 'Stretch' version of the operating system. This version is preferred in our laboratory because it already includes ROS (Robot Operating System). However, as mentioned in the [Raspberry forum](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=356182) it has come to our attention that the mirrors for this 'Stretch' version have recently been relocated from http://raspbian.raspberrypi.org/ or http://archive.raspberrypi.org/ to http://legacy.raspbian.org/

The original `source.list` file found at `/etc/apt` in the Turtlebots comes with these links:

```
deb http://raspbian.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/ stretch main contrib non-free rpi
# Uncomment line below then 'apt-get update' to enable 'apt-get source'
#deb-src http://raspbian.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/ stretch main contrib non-free rpi
```

When trying to `apt update` we'd get the next errors:

```

```

To address this issue, we found a straightforward solution â€“ updating the 'source.list' file, the updated version can be found here with the name `newsourcefile.list`. Given that we have multiple TurtleBots in the laboratory, I decided to create a Bash script. This script simplifies the task of updating 'source.list' across all TurtleBots, ensuring consistency and efficiency in our maintenance procedures.
